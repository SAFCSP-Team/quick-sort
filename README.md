# Quick Sort


### Objective

In this project, we will cover the fundamentals of a `Quick Sort Algorithm`.

### Problem

Write a method that sorts an array of elements `{10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5}` using the `Quick Sort algorithm`. The method should take an unsorted array as input and return the sorted array.

### Implementation
The final array should come out to be as `{1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}`.

```java

public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args){

  /* your code here */
	
  }
}

```
